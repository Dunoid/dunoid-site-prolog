Prolog, JavaScript, CSS, Amazon Web Services
#
This site was made entirely in Prolog and JavaScript, and is running on an EC2 instance from Amazon Web Services.  I programmed everything from the CSS to my authentication system and password storage.  I've been working on this site since mid-October, and it's been getting more and more features ever since.  One recent feature, for example, is a page where I can submit new subtopics like this from any web browser.
